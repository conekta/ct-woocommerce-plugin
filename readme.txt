WooCommerce Payment Gateway for Conekta.io

This bundles functionality to process credit cards and cash (OXXO) payments securely as well as send email notifications to your customers when they complete a successful purchase.

== Description ==

Current version features:

* Uses Conekta.js      - No PCI Compliance Issues ( Requires an SSL Certificate)
* Credit and Debit Card implemented
* Cash payments implemented
* Sandbox testing capability.
* Automatic order status management
* Email notifications on successful purchase

== Installation ==
Please note, v. 3.0.1 requires WooCommerce 3.x.
You can download an older version [here.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/conekta-payment-gateway/advanced/)
Make sure that you have at least PHP Version 5.6 since the Conekta PHP library requires this version.

###Automatic
Log in to your  Wordpress Dashboard, navigate to the plugins menu and click Add New, in the search field type “Conekta Payment Gateway” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

###Manual
* Upload the plugin zip file in Plugins > Add New and then click "Install Now"
* Once installed, activate the plugin.
* Add your API keys in Woocommerce > Settings > Checkout from your Conekta account (admin.conekta.io) in https://admin.conekta.io#developers.keys
* To manage orders for offline payments so that the status changes dynamically, you will need to add the following url as a webhook in your Conekta account:
http://tusitio.com/wc-api/WC_Conekta_Cash_Gateway

Replace to tusitio.com with your domain name

== Screenshots ==
1. In your Woocommerce admin in Settings > Checkout, you will need to add the API Keys from your Conekta.io account

2. Also, you will need o configure webhooks correctly in your conekta account adding http://tusitio.com/wc-api/WC_Conekta_Cash_Gateway so that the order status changes dynamically

3. Once the user pays with the reference the order status in your Woocommerce admin will automatically change

4. You will need to configure SSL since the user will be entering their credit card information directly in the checkout. They will not be redirected to another page.
